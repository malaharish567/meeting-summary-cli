Priya: Good morning, everyone. Let’s start with updates on the new mobile app release timeline.

Arjun: Development is about 80% complete. The backend APIs are stable, but we still need to finish integrating the payment gateway. That should take another week.

Kavya: On the design side, the new onboarding flow is ready. I’ve shared the prototypes with the team. Feedback has been positive, but we’ll need to tweak the color contrast for accessibility.

Ramesh: QA has started testing the login and profile modules. We’ve found a few minor bugs, mostly related to error messages not displaying correctly. Nothing critical so far.

Priya: Thanks. Let’s aim to wrap development by next Friday so QA can get a full week of testing before the release. Any blockers?

Arjun: The payment gateway integration depends on credentials from the vendor. I’ve already requested them, but we’re waiting.

Priya: Noted. I’ll follow up with the vendor today. Anything else?

Kavya: Just a reminder that we’ll need final approval from the branding team before locking the UI.

Priya: Good point. I’ll schedule a review with them early next week. If there’s nothing else, let’s close here. Thanks, everyone.
